# Supplementary Materials for *Weak biases emerging from vocal tract anatomy shape the repeated transmission of vowels*

This contains the Supplementary Materials for the https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0663-x paper.

Please see `SIGuide.pdf` for details, but note that the individual folders are *not* ZIP'd here.

Basically:

  - `SupplementaryResults` contains the actual full results as `HTML` documents (ZIP'd to save bandwidth) -- this is probably what most people would find most interesting,
  - `SupplementaryData` contains the various data needed to understand the paper,
  - `SupplementarySoftware1` and `SupplementarySoftware2` are the `Rmarkdown` scripts (+ data) that contain the code for analysis and plotting (please note that, to protect our participants' identitiy, not all the data needed to run `SupplementarySoftware2` are made available, so this script will actually **not** run, but its results are contained in the `SupplementaryResults2.html` document!),
  - `SupplementarySoftware3` contains the code and data needed to run the simulations (please also see the GitHub repos https://github.com/ddediu/let-the-agents-do-the-talking and https://github.com/ddediu/larynx-height),
  - `SIGuide.pdf` is a full guide to all this...
